# Exercise 4 The Dockerfile


> But what about scripts with modules?
â€“ You

You will often encounter the situation where you use some python modules. These are not stored next to your script (like with node_modules). They are tucked away in some obscure location on your computer depending on how you run/install python. These modules are also packed for your operating system and maybe not compatible with the Linux distro that was used for your container. The solution is to write a `Dockerfile` and build our image ourselves based on another image.
