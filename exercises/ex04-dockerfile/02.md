# Exercise 4


If everything went fine you should now have a new image. Take a look by running the next command.

```bash
docker images
```

## Task

- [ ] How to run this image?
- [ ] Write a Dockerfile for Node.js?

The concept is the same. You need three files `package.json`, `index.js` and `Dockerfile`. 

!Hint: There might be a special image for Node.js. Take a look at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).
