# Exercise 4

## Create an Image

- Open this folder in VSCode
- Create 3 files `cow.py`, `requirements.txt` and one `Dockerfile`

---

1. The script with the dependency we want to run. In our case `cow.py`
2. the `requirements.txt `file that holds our dependencies we can install with `pip`
3. The `Dockerfile` that describes how our image shoulde be structured

This is `cow.py`

```python
from cowsay import cow
cow("Hello Docker")
```

This is `requirements.txt`

```plain
cowsay==2.0.3
```

This is our `Dockerfile`. Please read the comments between the lines to know what each command does.

```bash
# the base image we use to build upon
FROM python:3.7.7-stretch
# we set the working directory
WORKDIR /cows
# we copy our requirements into the imagr
COPY ./requirements.txt requirements.txt
# we run the install with pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# we copy our script into the image
COPY cow.py cow.py
# we define the executable that we will call
ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]
# we set the arguments for that executable
CMD ["cow.py"]
```


To build our image we run the following command in the directory where the three files are located.

```bash
docker build --tag technologiestiftung/cows ./
# show the image
docker images
```
