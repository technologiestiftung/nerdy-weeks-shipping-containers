# Exercise 9 Publishing

## Prerequisites

- a GitHub personal access token
- a DockerHub Account

## Docker Hub

Currently the go to place for all images. Starting November 1, 2020 the retention period for unused images on free accounts will be set to 6 month. Means that, if you want to archive things you will have to publish your project to github or pay for an account. If you just push it it might get lost.

Login into the docker hub registry with your accounts username and password.

```bash
docker login
```
