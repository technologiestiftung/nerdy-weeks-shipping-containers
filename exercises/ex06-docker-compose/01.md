# Exercise 6 docker-compose

## Daily Commands

`docker-compose` needs to be executed next to a `docker-compose.yml` file.
These are commands that you will run on a daily basis.

```bash
# ls
# . .. docker-compose.yml
# 
docker-compose up
# or if you need to rebuild the containers
docker-compose up --build
# send it to the background
docker-compose up --detach
# only start a specific service
docker-compose up --detach postgres
# if your containers already exist
docker-compose start
docker-compose stop
# to remove the containers
docker-compose down
```
