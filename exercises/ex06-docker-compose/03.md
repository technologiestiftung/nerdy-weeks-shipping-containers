# Exercise 6

## A `docker-compose` setup for a Node.js Project


This is the `docker-compose.yml`

```yml
version: "3.1"
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

This is the `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm","start"]
```

## Task
