# Exercise 8 Docker Network

Docker Network. 

When defining a service its name is the key for the network. If you call your database service `postgres` it will be reachable in the network as the host `postgres`. Call it `db` and the host will be `db`. 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Task

 Ups someone left an error in the client code. Where can we get the variables for host, user and password from in the file `client/index.ts`?

- [ ] fix `client/index.ts` so it can run and get the text from the DB.
