# Exercise 5 Run Postgres

Running Postgres with the an example from the docs.

```bash
# this is what the docs say
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
# then run the command below to find your running containers
docker ps
```


If you need to remove an container run:

```bash
docker rm some-postgres
```

You can move into the container by running:

```bash
# 
# then run the command below to find your running containers
docker ps
# now exec a bash session inside of it
docker exec -it some-postgres /bin/bash
```
