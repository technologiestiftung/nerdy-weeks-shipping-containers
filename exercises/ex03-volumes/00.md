# Exercise 3

Share some disk:

Docker containers are totally separate from our filesystem. Which is a good thing. We don't share any dependencies and we have a fully isolated environment. What if we want to run a file we have on our computer within the docker container? 

This can be done by mapping a file or folder in our filesystem to the filesystem created within the container. This can be done using the flag `-v, --volume list Bind mount a volume`.
