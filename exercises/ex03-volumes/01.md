# Exercise 3 Volumes


## Run a Python Script

In the example below you can see this in action.


```bash
# To test this we first need to create the file `test.py`. 
echo "print('Hello Docker')" > test.py

docker run --volume "$PWD:/scripts" --workdir /scripts python python test.py

```

```plain
docker run --volume "$PWD:/scripts" --workdir /scripts python python test.py
