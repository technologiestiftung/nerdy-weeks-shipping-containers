# Exercise 2 Run Ubuntu


## Install Some Software

On ubuntu you normally install software by running
 
```bash
# Hint! You first need to update the package references
apt-get update
# Hint!: In the container you don't need sudo
apt-get install <SOFTWARE NAME>
# or
apt install <SOFTWARE NAME>
# e.g. cowsay or fortune
# Warning! They are not in your path yet
# they get installed in /usr/games
```
