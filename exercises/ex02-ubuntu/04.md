# Exercise 2 Run Ubuntu

Once you exited your ubuntu your changes are gone. How can we keep them?

```bash
# lets run our session again
docker run --interactive --tty ubuntu
# and make some changes like before
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install curl -y
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 14
nvm alias default 14
mkdir /app && cd /app
echo 'console.log("ubuntu")' > index.js
```

In another session:

```bash
# we need to find the id of our running container
docker ps
# when we have it - use it like this to save your changes
docker commit <CONTAINER ID> <USERNAME/ORG>/<REPONAME>:<TAG>
# then run
docker images
# take a look at 
# docker commit --help
# and
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/
```
