# Exercise 12 nginx Reverse Proxy

Nginx as reverse proxy.

This is a more sophisticated example where a Nginx is running as a "gateway" to the internet and sending traffic to the API and the client/frontend. the reverse proxy takes care of the routing between these applications and could also be used as a load balancer.
This setup can be used on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a multi docker setup.

```plain
     The Internet
          ^
          |
          |
          +
Reverse Proxy (nginx)
^                   ^
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
+                   +
API    Client (nginx)
```

Run it with the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose up
```
After that open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and take a look into the developer console.
